# Tangible Nails & Art Studio — Booking System

Full-stack booking and studio management web application built for Tangible Nails & Art Studio, a nail salon based in Chihuahua, Mexico.

## Overview
Tangible is a mobile-first SaaS-style booking platform that allows clients to browse services, select appointment times based on real availability, and confirm bookings via WhatsApp. The studio owner manages appointments, schedules, blocked dates, and reminders through a secure admin dashboard.

## Features
- Service catalog with category accordion (nails, manicure, makeup, eyebrows).
- Real-time availability algorithm based on configurable weekly schedule and blocked dates.
- Client-side localStorage with 90-day expiry and input sanitization.
- WhatsApp-based booking confirmation flow.
- Secure admin dashboard with JWT authentication and bcrypt password hashing.
- Appointment management with cancellation modal and status tracking.
- One-tap WhatsApp confirmation on admin-created appointments, plus a next-day reminder panel (single or send-all), all timezone-correct for Chihuahua (UTC-6). Message templates are centralized in `src/lib/whatsapp.ts`.
- Admin-only registration of past appointments (for accurate history/revenue); past days render faded in the calendar while the public flow still blocks past dates.
- Revenue metrics dashboard with week/month selector.
- QR code generator for in-studio display.
- Anti-bot honeypot field on booking form.
- Security headers including CSP, HSTS, and X-Frame-Options.

- Language: TypeScript
- Database: MongoDB Atlas via Prisma ORM

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iancorral/Nails_App
   cd Nails_App
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root with the following variables:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=

   # Optional — overrides the business name used in WhatsApp messages
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_NAME=
   ```

3. Generate the Prisma client and seed the service catalog:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx ts-node --project tsconfig.scripts.json prisma/seed.ts
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
