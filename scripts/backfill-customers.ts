// scripts/backfill-customers.ts
//
// One-shot migration for the Rewards module: turns the client details already
// denormalized on every appointment into real Customer records, and links each
// appointment back to its customer.
//
//   npm run backfill:customers          → dry run, writes nothing
//   npm run backfill:customers -- --apply
//
// Safe to run more than once: it upserts by phone and only writes the link on
// appointments that do not have one yet. Re-run it any time to repair
// appointments that were created while the database was unreachable.
//
// It deliberately grants NO stamps. Existing regulars start at zero; the owner
// hands out manual stamps from the admin panel if she wants to reward them.
